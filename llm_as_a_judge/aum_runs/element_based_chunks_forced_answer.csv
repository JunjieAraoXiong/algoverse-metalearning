0,What is the FY2018 capital expenditure amount (in USD millions) for 3M? Give a response to the question by relying on the details shown in the cash flow statement.,$1577.00,"The FY2018 capital expenditure amount for 3M can be calculated from the cash flow statement. The cash flow statement shows that the Net cash used for investing activities in FY2018 is $442.9 million. However, this amount includes other investing activities besides capital expenditures. 

To find the capital expenditure amount, we need to look at the change in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) from the balance sheet. Unfortunately, the exact change in PP&E is not provided in the given context. However, we can use the information from the ""Working Capital"" section to find the change in current assets and current liabilities, and then use the cash flow statement to find the capital expenditure amount.

From the ""Working Capital"" section, we know that the current assets decreased by $568 million and the current liabilities decreased by $443 million from FY2017 to FY2018. However, this information is not directly related to the capital expenditure amount.

From the cash flow statement, we know that the Net cash used for investing activities in FY2018 is $442.9 million. This amount includes the capital expenditure and other investing activities. Unfortunately, the exact capital expenditure amount is not provided in the given context.

However, we can use the information from the ""Free Cash Flow"" section to find the capital expenditure amount. The Free Cash Flow section shows that the Purchases of property, plant and equipment in FY2021 is $1,749 million. Unfortunately, this information is for FY2021, not FY2018.

However, we can use the information from the ""Cash Flows from Investing Activities"" section to find the capital expenditure amount. The Cash Flows from Investing Activities section shows that the Net cash used for investing activities in FY2018 is $442.9 million. This amount includes the capital expenditure and other investing activities.

Unfortunately, the exact capital expenditure amount is not provided in the given context. However, we can make an educated estimate based on the information provided.

Assuming that the capital expenditure amount is a significant portion of the Net cash used for investing activities, we can estimate the capital expenditure amount to be around $442.9 million. However, this is just an estimate and the actual capital expenditure amount may be different.

Therefore, the estimated FY2018 capital expenditure amount for 3M is approximately $442.9 million.",0.5466695587318895,391.09086990356445,2948.838949203491,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf,,metrics-generated,3M,3M_2018_10K,10k,0.2,"The model's prediction is not factually correct, as the predicted value of $442.9 million is not aligned with the true answer.

1,Assume that you are a public equities analyst. Answer the following question by primarily using information that is shown in the balance sheet: what is the year end FY2018 net PPNE for 3M? Answer in USD billions.,$8.70,"To calculate the year-end FY2018 net PPNE (Property, Plant, and Net Equipment) for 3M, we need to use the information provided in the balance sheet. However, the balance sheet is not explicitly provided in the given context. 

We can use the information provided in the ""Selected Financial Data"" section to estimate the net PPNE. The total assets for 2018 are $36,500 million. We also know that the long-term debt (excluding portion due within one year) and long-term portion of debt is $138 million, and cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities are $3.3 billion.

Assuming that the remaining assets are primarily composed of PPNE, we can estimate the net PPNE as follows:

Total Assets = $36,500 million
Long-term debt = $138 million (this is not subtracted as it is already a liability)
Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities = $3,300 million (this is subtracted as it is not part of PPNE)

Estimated Net PPNE = Total Assets - Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities
Estimated Net PPNE = $36,500 million - $3,300 million
Estimated Net PPNE = $33,200 million

Converting this to USD billions:
Estimated Net PPNE = $33.2 billion

Please note that this is an estimate and the actual net PPNE may be different due to the presence of other assets and liabilities not accounted for in this calculation.",0.527774870133692,157.4540138244629,2626.4302730560303,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf,,metrics-generated,3M,3M_2018_10K,10k,0.3,"The model's predicted answer is not factually correct, as it does not align with the true answer.

2,Is 3M a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data?,"No, the company is managing its CAPEX and Fixed Assets pretty efficiently, which is evident from below key metrics:
CAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%
Fixed assets/Total Assets: 20%
Return on Assets= 12.4%","To determine if 3M is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data, we need to analyze the company's capital spending and its relation to its overall business.

From the provided context, we can see that 3M's capital spending is significant, with a focus on investments in property, plant, and equipment to drive growth and increase manufacturing efficiency. However, we do not have a direct measure of capital intensity.

One way to estimate capital intensity is to look at the ratio of capital spending to revenue. Unfortunately, the context does not provide revenue data for FY2022. However, we can look at the company's working capital and cash flow data to get an idea of its capital requirements.

In FY2022, 3M had $14.688 billion in current assets and $9.523 billion in current liabilities, resulting in working capital of $5.165 billion. The company also had $3.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

While these numbers do not directly indicate capital intensity, they suggest that 3M has significant capital requirements to fund its operations and growth initiatives.

Based on this analysis, it is likely that 3M is a capital-intensive business, given its significant investments in property, plant, and equipment, and its large working capital and cash requirements. However, without more detailed data, we cannot make a definitive conclusion.",0.6764665605898126,155.56883811950684,1853.3718585968015,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf,,domain-relevant,3M,3M_2022_10K,10k,0.3,"The model's prediction is not entirely correct or incorrect as it leans towards 3M being a capital-intensive business, but it doesn't give a definitive answer.

3,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","Based on the provided context, the operating margin change for 3M as of FY2022 was driven by several factors. 

The table provided in the context shows the increases (decreases) in operating income margins and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. According to the table, the operating income margin for 2022 was 22.3%, and the changes in operating income margin were driven by the following factors:

- Organic growth/productivity and other: 0.7% increase
- Gain on business divestitures: 1.0% increase
- Divestiture-related restructuring actions: (1.2)% decrease
- Net costs for significant litigation: (0.2)% decrease

Additionally, the context mentions that operating income margins increased year-on-year due to benefits from organic local-currency growth and productivity, in addition to lower year-on-year portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges. However, operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense.

Operating margin can be a useful metric for a company like 3M, as it provides insight into the company's ability to generate earnings from its sales. However, it may not be the most comprehensive metric, as it does not take into account other factors that can impact a company's profitability, such as interest expenses, taxes, and non-operating income.",0.7869503531495041,238.70587348937988,2526.019096374512,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/MICROSOFT_2023_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf,,domain-relevant,3M,3M_2022_10K,10k,0.85,"The model's predicted answer is correct and relevant, providing details on the factors driving the change in operating margin for 3M in FY2022.

4,"If we exclude the impact of M&A, which segment has dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022?",The consumer segment shrunk by 0.9% organically.,"Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which segment dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022, excluding the impact of M&A. However, we can infer some information from the given data.

The context mentions that the divestiture impacts in 2022 include lost income from divested businesses and remaining stranded costs, specifically the split-off of the Food Safety business in September 2022 and the deconsolidation of the Aearo Entities in July 2022. 

Additionally, the context mentions that 3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. However, it does not provide specific information on the performance of each segment in 2022.

Given the information available, we can only speculate that the segment that dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022, excluding the impact of M&A, might be related to the Health Care segment, as the context mentions the split-off of the Food Safety business and the deconsolidation of the Aearo Entities, which could be related to the Health Care segment. However, this is purely speculative and not explicitly stated in the context.

Therefore, based on the available information, the best answer would be that the segment that dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022, excluding the impact of M&A, is likely related to the Health Care segment, but this is not explicitly confirmed in the context.",0.5785710500599093,145.05314826965332,2221.26579284668,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf,,novel-generated,3M,3M_2022_10K,10k,0.3,"The model's prediction is not fully correct as it does not provide the exact segment that dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022, excluding M&A.

5,"Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark","Based on the provided context, we can calculate the quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023. However, the context does not provide the exact figures for current assets and current liabilities for Q2 of FY2023. It only provides the figures for December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.

However, we can calculate the quick ratio for December 31, 2022, and use it as a proxy for Q2 of FY2023. The quick ratio is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.

From the provided context, we have:

Current Assets (December 31, 2022) = $14,688 million
Current Liabilities (December 31, 2022) = $9,523 million

However, we do not have the exact figure for Inventory. Therefore, we cannot calculate the quick ratio accurately.

But we can calculate the working capital, which is a non-GAAP measure defined by 3M as Current Assets minus Current Liabilities.

Working Capital (December 31, 2022) = $14,688 million - $9,523 million = $5,165 million

This indicates that 3M has a positive working capital, which suggests a reasonably healthy liquidity profile. However, the quick ratio is not relevant in this case due to the lack of inventory data.

It's worth noting that 3M's commercial paper program and its ability to access the commercial paper market also suggest a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.",0.7338297295835392,337.33510971069336,2224.294185638428,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf,,domain-relevant,3M,3M_2023Q2_10Q,10q,0.3,"The model's answer is partially correct.

8,What is the FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard? Fixed asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2019 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2018 and FY2019). Round your answer to two decimal places. Base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the statement of income and the statement of financial position.,24.26,"To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio for FY2019, we need to find the FY2019 revenue and the average PP&E between FY2018 and FY2019.

From the Reconciliation to consolidated net revenues table, we can find the FY2019 revenue: $6,489 million.

To find the average PP&E, we need to find the PP&E for FY2018 and FY2019. The PP&E is not directly provided, but we can find the long-lived assets by geographic region, which includes property, plant, and equipment assets, and lease ROU assets. 

From the Long-lived assets by geographic region table, we can find the total long-lived assets for FY2019: $485 million and for FY2018: $282 million.

Now, we can calculate the average PP&E: ($282 million + $485 million) / 2 = $383.5 million.

Finally, we can calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio for FY2019: $6,489 million / $383.5 million = 16.93.

9,What is the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.,1.9%,"To calculate the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard, we need to first find the capex and revenue for each year.

From the provided context, we can find the following information:

- FY2019 revenue: $6,489 million (from the reconciliation to consolidated net revenues table)
- FY2018 revenue: $7,500 million (from the reconciliation to consolidated net revenues table)
- FY2017 revenue: Not directly provided, but we can find the FY2017 segment net revenues: $5,969 million (from the table of contents) and the FY2017 consolidated net revenues: $6,782 million (from the table of contents) and $6,746 million (from the table of contents), we will use $6,782 million as the FY2017 revenue.

- FY2019 capex: Not directly provided, but we can find the FY2019 depreciation and amortization: $328 million (from the consolidated statements of cash flows) and the FY2019 amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses: $225 million (from the consolidated statements of cash flows). We will use the sum of these two values as the FY2019 capex: $553 million.
- FY2018 capex: Not directly provided, but we can find the FY2018 depreciation and amortization: $509 million (from the consolidated statements of cash flows) and the FY2018 amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses: $489 million (from the consolidated statements of cash flows). We will use the sum of these two values as the FY2018 capex: $998 million.
- FY2017 capex: Not directly provided, but we can find the FY2017 depreciation and amortization: Not provided, and the FY2017 amortization of capitalized software development costs and intellectual property licenses: Not provided. We will assume the FY2017 capex is the same as the FY2018 capex: $998 million.

Now we can calculate the capex as a % of revenue for each year:

- FY2019: ($553 million / $6,489 million) * 100% ≈ 8.5%
- FY2018: ($998 million / $7,500 million) * 100% ≈ 13.3%
- FY2017: ($998 million / $6,782 million) * 100% ≈ 14.7%

Since we cannot find the cash from operations for FY2015, we will use the cash from operations for FY2016, which is $6,775,905 (in thousands). We will convert this to millions by dividing by 1,000. The cash from operations for FY2016 is $6,775.905 million.

To find the total current liabilities for FY2015, we need to look at the statement of financial position. However, the statement of financial position is not provided in the context.

11,What is Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.,65.4%,"To calculate Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, we need to find the operating income for both years.

However, the provided context does not explicitly provide the operating income for FY2015 and FY2016. But we can calculate it using the given data.

For FY2016, we can calculate the operating income as follows:

Net income for FY2016 = $1,168,782 (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)

Provision for income taxes for FY2016 = $502,298 (from the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)

Operating income for FY2016 = Net income + Provision for income taxes
= $1,168,782 + $502,298
= $1,671,080

For FY2015, we can calculate the operating income as follows:

Net income for FY2015 = $305,824 (from the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)

Provision for income taxes for FY2015 = $305,824 (from the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) is actually the net income, and the provision for income taxes is not explicitly provided. However, we can find the income before income taxes for FY2015 from the Selected Quarterly Financial Data.

Income before income taxes for FY2015 = $163,248 + $180,974 + $232,619 + $296,940
= $873,781

Provision for income taxes for FY2015 = Income before income taxes - Net income
= $873,781 - $305,824
= $567,957

Operating income for FY2015 = Income before income taxes + Provision for income taxes (this is not correct, we should use the income before income taxes and subtract the net income to get the provision for income taxes, then add the provision for income taxes to the income before income taxes to get the operating income, but the provision for income taxes is not the correct value to add)
However, we can calculate the operating income using the income before income taxes and the net income.

Operating income for FY2015 = Income before income taxes - Net income + Provision for income taxes (this is not correct)
However, we can calculate the operating income using the income before income taxes and the net income.

Operating income for FY2015 = Income before income taxes - Net income + Provision for income taxes (this is not correct)
However, we can calculate the operating income using the income before income taxes and the net income.

Net cash provided by operating activities: $6,775,905 (in thousands)

To convert this to millions, we divide by 1,000:

$6,775,905 / 1,000 = $6,775.905 million

However, we need the total current liabilities for FY2017 to calculate the operating cash flow ratio. Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain the balance sheet information for FY2017. 

However, we can still attempt to find the total current liabilities for FY2017. Since the provided context does not contain the balance sheet information for FY2017, we will use the information from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (In thousands) for December 1, 2017, and the information from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (In millions) for December 2, 2022.

From the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (In millions) for December 2, 2022:

From the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (In thousands) for December 1, 2017:

13,"Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.,"Based on the provided context, Adobe's operating margin profile as of FY2022 is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer some information from the given data.

In the section discussing the components of year-on-year changes in operating income margin, it is mentioned that operating income margins increased year-on-year due to benefits from organic local-currency growth and productivity, in addition to lower year-on-year portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges. However, operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense.

Additionally, the table showing the components of year-on-year changes in operating income margin and earnings per diluted share for FY2022 indicates that the total operating income margin was 22.3% (or 20.8% excluding special items).

Considering the mixed factors affecting operating income margins, it is not clear whether Adobe's operating margin profile is improving as of FY2022. However, the fact that operating income margins increased due to organic growth and productivity suggests a positive trend.

It is also worth noting that operating margin might not be the most useful metric for a company like Adobe, which is heavily focused on software and digital products. This is because operating margins can be influenced by various factors such as research and development expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and other non-cash items. A more relevant metric for Adobe might be its gross margin, which is not explicitly provided in the context.",0.8449001774129482,141.59083366394043,2158.374786376953,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2018_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf,,domain-relevant,Adobe,ADOBE_2022_10K,10k,0.4,"The model's prediction is partially correct but lacks clear factual alignment with the true answer.

14,Does Adobe have an improving Free cashflow conversion as of FY2022?,"Yes, the FCF conversion (using net income as the denominator) for Adobe has improved by ~13% from 143% in 2021 to 156% in 2022","To determine if Adobe has an improving free cash flow conversion as of FY2022, we need to calculate the free cash flow conversion ratio. 

Free cash flow conversion ratio = (Free cash flow / Net income) * 100

From the provided context, we can find the following information for FY2022:

Net income = $4,756 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)

To calculate the free cash flow, we need to find the net cash provided by operating activities and subtract the capital expenditures. However, the context does not provide the capital expenditures for FY2022. 

But we can find the net cash provided by operating activities = $5,260 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)

Assuming the capital expenditures are not significant, we can use the net cash provided by operating activities as a proxy for the free cash flow.

Free cash flow conversion ratio ≈ (5,260 / 4,756) * 100 ≈ 110.6%

However, to determine if the free cash flow conversion is improving, we need to compare it with the previous year's ratio. Unfortunately, the context does not provide the necessary information for the previous year.

But we can find the net income and net cash provided by operating activities for FY2021:

Net income = $4,822 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)

Net cash provided by operating activities = $5,010 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)

Free cash flow conversion ratio for FY2021 ≈ (5,010 / 4,822) * 100 ≈ 103.9%

Comparing the two ratios, we can see that the free cash flow conversion ratio has improved from approximately 103.9% in FY2021 to approximately 110.6% in FY2022.

Therefore, based on the available information, it appears that Adobe has an improving free cash flow conversion as of FY2022.",0.8069223319038732,151.98707580566406,3125.6120204925537,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf,,novel-generated,Adobe,ADOBE_2022_10K,10k,0.9,"The model's response is largely correct, providing a detailed calculation and comparison to determine if Adobe's free cash flow conversion has improved.

DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,93.86,"To calculate Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO), we need to find the following values:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017
2. FY2017 COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
3. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017

From the provided context, we can find the following values:

1. Accounts payable for FY2016 and FY2017:
   - FY2016: Not directly provided, but we can use the FY2017 and FY2018 values to estimate. 
   - FY2017: $39 billion (from the table of contents)
   - FY2018: $53 billion (from the table of contents)

Since we don't have the exact FY2016 value, we will use the FY2017 value as an estimate for the average accounts payable.

Average accounts payable = ($39 billion + $53 billion) / 2 = $46 billion

However, we should note that this is an estimate and actual average accounts payable might be different.

2. FY2017 COGS:
   - Not directly provided in the context. However, we can use the FY2020 and FY2021 values to estimate the COGS for FY2017. 
   - FY2020: $104,819 million (from the table of contents)
   - FY2021: $133,364 million (from the table of contents)

Since we don't have the exact FY2017 value, we will use the FY2020 value as an estimate for the COGS in FY2017.

COGS FY2017 = $104,819 million (estimated)

3. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017:
   - Not directly provided in the context. However, we can use the FY2020 and FY2021 values to estimate the change in inventory. 
   - FY2020: $25,180 million (from the table of contents)
   - FY2021: $34,433 million (from the table of contents)

Since we don't have the exact FY2016 and FY2017 values, we will use the change in inventory between FY2020 and FY2021 as an estimate.

Change in inventory = $34,433 million - $25,180 million = $9,253 million (estimated)

110,What is the FY2016 COGS for Microsoft? Please state answer in USD millions. Provide a response to the question by primarily using the statement of income.,$32780.00,"Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain the statement of income for Microsoft Corporation for FY2016. However, we can try to estimate the COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) for FY2016 using the given information.

From the context, we have the following information for Microsoft Corporation:

- Revenue for FY2016: $68,133 million (from the unaudited pro forma basis table)
- Net income for FY2016: $6,872 million (from the unaudited pro forma basis table)
- Income before income taxes for FY2016: $19,751 million (from the table of income before income taxes)

We can use the following formula to estimate the COGS:

COGS = Revenue - Gross Profit

However, we do not have the Gross Profit information directly. We can try to estimate the Gross Profit using the Net Income and Income before income taxes.

Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
Operating Income = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
Income before income taxes = Operating Income + Non-operating income

We can rearrange the formulas to get:

COGS = Revenue - (Income before income taxes - Non-operating income - Operating Expenses)

Unfortunately, we do not have the Non-operating income and Operating Expenses information for FY2016. However, we can try to estimate the COGS using the given information.

Assuming the Non-operating income and Operating Expenses are relatively small compared to the Revenue and Income before income taxes, we can estimate the COGS as follows:

COGS ≈ Revenue - (Income before income taxes - Net Income)

COGS ≈ $68,133 million - ($19,751 million - $6,872 million)
COGS ≈ $68,133 million - $12,879 million
