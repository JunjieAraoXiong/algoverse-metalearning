3,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","The operating margin change for 3M in FY2022 was driven by several factors, including:

1. Declines in disposable respirator demand, which negatively impacted operating margins by 0.3 percent.
2. Benefits from strong pricing, spending discipline, and 2021 restructuring actions, which resulted in a net year-on-year benefit of 1.3 percent to operating margins.
3. Manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges, geopolitical impacts due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, and ongoing COVID-related challenges in China.
4. Increased investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.

However, it's worth noting that operating margin may not be a useful metric for a company like 3M, which has a complex business structure with multiple segments and a significant amount of special items. The company's operating margin was impacted by several one-time items, such as the gain on business divestitures, goodwill impairment expense, and PFAS manufacturing exit costs, which can make it difficult to compare year-over-year performance.

Additionally, 3M's business is highly diversified, with four operating business segments, and the company's performance can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including changes in demand, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical events. Therefore, it may be more useful to look at other metrics, such as adjusted operating income or free cash flow, which can provide a more comprehensive view of the company's performance.",0.7596701302279966,588.6416435241699,2451.8136978149414,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf,,0.45,"The predicted answer contains some correct information about the factors affecting 3M's operating margin, but it does not mention the specific one-off charges mentioned in the ground truth, such as Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing.

5,"Does 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.","No. The quick ratio for 3M was 0.96 by Jun'23 close, which needs a bit of an improvement to touch the 1x mark","The quick ratio is not explicitly provided in the context, but we can calculate it using the available data. The quick ratio is calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.

From the context, we have the following data:
- Current Assets: $15,754 million (as of June 30, 2023)
- Current Liabilities: $10,936 million (as of June 30, 2023)
- Inventory is not explicitly provided, but we can use the Working Capital (non-GAAP measure) data to estimate the change in inventory. Working Capital decreased by $0.3 billion, and balance changes in current assets increased working capital by $1.1 billion, driven largely by increases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Balance changes in current liabilities decreased working capital by $1.4 billion, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings driven by issuances of commercial paper and increases in other current liabilities. Since inventory is not explicitly mentioned as a factor in the change in working capital, we can assume that the change in inventory is relatively small compared to the changes in cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and current liabilities.

However, without the exact value of inventory, we cannot accurately calculate the quick ratio. 

Instead, we can look at the working capital (non-GAAP measure) provided in the context, which is $4,818 million as of June 30, 2023. This measure is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. A positive working capital indicates that 3M has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, which is a good indicator of liquidity.

Additionally, the context mentions that 3M maintains a strong liquidity profile, with primary short-term liquidity needs met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. The Company also has a $4.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2028, which provides additional liquidity.

Based on this information, it appears that 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, but the quick ratio is not explicitly calculable from the provided data.",0.6439166195963008,746.1199760437012,3662.014961242676,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2023Q2_10Q.pdf,,0.4,"The predicted answer provides some correct information about 3M's liquidity profile, but it does not directly answer the question about the quick ratio and its relevance to measuring liquidity.

8,What is the FY2019 fixed asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard? Fixed asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2019 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2018 and FY2019). Round your answer to two decimal places. Base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the statement of income and the statement of financial position.,24.26,"To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio, we need to calculate the average PP&E between FY2018 and FY2019.

PP&E at December 31, 2018: $253 million
PP&E at December 31, 2019: $253 million

Average PP&E = ($253 + $253) / 2 = $253 million

Now, we can calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio:

FY2019 revenue: $6,489 million
Fixed asset turnover ratio = FY2019 revenue / Average PP&E
= $6,489 million / $253 million
= 25.65

9,What is the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.,1.9%,"To calculate the 3-year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard, we need to extract the relevant data from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.

From the statement of income, we can extract the total net revenues for each year:

- FY2017: $7,017 million
- FY2018: $7,500 million
- FY2019: $6,489 million

From the cash flow statement, we can extract the capital expenditures (capex) for each year:

- FY2017: $155 million
- FY2018: $131 million
- FY2019: $116 million

Now, we can calculate the capex as a % of revenue for each year:

- FY2017: ($155 million / $7,017 million) * 100% ≈ 2.2%
- FY2018: ($131 million / $7,500 million) * 100% ≈ 1.7%
- FY2019: ($116 million / $6,489 million) * 100% ≈ 1.8%

Finally, we can calculate the 3-year average of capex as a % of revenue:

(2.2% + 1.7% + 1.8%) / 3 ≈ 1.9%

So, the FY2017 - FY2019 3-year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard is approximately 1.9%.",0.27684933493243324,1392.6432132720947,3116.196870803833,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf,,1.0,"The predicted answer perfectly matches the ground truth, providing the same factual information, including the calculation steps and the final answer, making it a complete and relevant response.",metrics-generated,Activision Blizzard,ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K,10k
10,You are an investment banker and your only resource(s) to answer the following question is (are): the statement of financial position and the cash flow statement.

Round your answer to two decimal places.,0.66,"To calculate the FY2015 operating cash flow ratio for Adobe, we need to find the cash from operations and total current liabilities.

From the cash flow statement, we can see that the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 is $1,469.5 million.

However, the statement of financial position is not provided in the given context. But we can find the total current liabilities from the Consolidated Financial Statements (in thousands) as of November 27, 2015.

Total current liabilities = $7,253,431 (Total current assets) - $7,001,580 (Total current assets - Total current liabilities) = $251,851 (in thousands)

Now, we can calculate the FY2015 operating cash flow ratio for Adobe:

Operating cash flow ratio = Cash from operations / Total current liabilities
= $1,469,500,000 / $251,851,000
= 5.84

Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.,65.4%,"To calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, we need to first calculate the operating income for both years.

Operating income for FY2016 = Total revenue - Total cost of revenue - Total operating expenses
= $5,854,430 - $819,908 - $3,540,920
= $1,493,602

Operating income for FY2015 = Total revenue - Total cost of revenue - Total operating expenses
= $4,795,511 - $744,317 - $3,148,099
= $903,095

Now, we can calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income:

Year-over-year change = ((Operating income for FY2016 - Operating income for FY2015) / Operating income for FY2015) * 100
= (($1,493,602 - $903,095) / $903,095) * 100

Please utilize information provided primarily within the balance sheet and the cash flow statement.,0.83,"To calculate the FY2017 operating cash flow ratio for Adobe, we need to find the cash from operations and total current liabilities.

From the provided context, we can find the cash from operations in the Cash Flows from Operating Activities section:

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017: $2,912.9 million

However, we cannot find the total current liabilities directly in the provided context. But we can find the working capital, which is the difference between total current assets and total current liabilities.

From the LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES section:

Working capital as of December 1, 2017: $3,720.4 million
Cash and cash equivalents as of December 1, 2017: $2,306.1 million
Short-term investments as of December 1, 2017: $3,513.7 million

Total current assets = Cash and cash equivalents + Short-term investments = $2,306.1 million + $3,513.7 million = $5,819.8 million

Now, we can find the total current liabilities:

Total current liabilities = Total current assets - Working capital
= $5,819.8 million - $3,720.4 million
= $2,099.4 million

Now, we can calculate the FY2017 operating cash flow ratio:

Operating cash flow ratio = Cash from operations / Total current liabilities
= $2,912.9 million / $2,099.4 million
= 1.39

Rounded to two decimal places, the FY2017 operating cash flow ratio for Adobe is 1.39.",0.22230856718291256,540.9679412841797,2324.21612739563,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf,,0.0,"The predicted answer is completely incorrect, with a calculated ratio of 1.39 instead of the correct 0.83, indicating a significant error in the calculation or interpretation of the provided data.",metrics-generated,Adobe,ADOBE_2017_10K,10k
13,"Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.",No the operating margins of Adobe have recently declined from 36.8% in FY 2021 to 34.6% in FY2022. A drop by 2.2% in a year.,"Adobe's operating margin profile is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can calculate the operating margin for FY2022 and FY2021 to assess the trend.

Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by revenue.

For FY2022:
Operating income = Total revenue - Total operating expenses
= $17,606 - $9,343
= $8,263

Operating margin = Operating income / Total revenue
= $8,263 / $17,606
= 46.9%

For FY2021:
Operating income = Total revenue - Total operating expenses
= $15,785 - $8,118
= $7,667

Operating margin = Operating income / Total revenue
= $7,667 / $15,785
= 48.6%

Based on the calculations, Adobe's operating margin has actually decreased from 48.6% in FY2021 to 46.9% in FY2022.

However, it's worth noting that operating margin might not be the most useful metric for a company like Adobe, which has a significant portion of its revenue coming from subscription-based services. This is because subscription-based revenue can be more predictable and recurring, which might not be fully reflected in the operating margin.

14,Does Adobe have an improving Free cashflow conversion as of FY2022?,"Yes, the FCF conversion (using net income as the denominator) for Adobe has improved by ~13% from 143% in 2021 to 156% in 2022","To determine if Adobe has an improving free cash flow conversion as of FY2022, we need to calculate the free cash flow conversion ratio for FY2022 and compare it to the previous year.

Free cash flow conversion ratio is calculated as (Net cash provided by operating activities - Capital expenditures) / Net income.

From the provided context, we can find the following data for FY2022 and FY2021:

FY2022:
- Net cash provided by operating activities: $7,838 million
- Capital expenditures are not explicitly provided, but we can find the ""Net cash used for investing activities"" which includes capital expenditures: ($570 million). However, this also includes other investing activities, so we will use this as a proxy for capital expenditures.
- Net income: $4,756 million

FY2021:
- Net cash provided by operating activities: $7,230 million
- Net cash used for investing activities: ($3,537 million)
- Net income: $4,822 million

Now, let's calculate the free cash flow conversion ratio for both years:

FY2022: ($7,838 million - $570 million) / $4,756 million ≈ 1.53
FY2021: ($7,230 million - $3,537 million) / $4,822 million ≈ 0.76

Comparing the two ratios, we can see that the free cash flow conversion ratio has improved in FY2022 compared to FY2021.",0.7532473524072748,394.1168785095215,3507.751941680908,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2022_10K.pdf,,0.7,"The predicted answer correctly states that Adobe's free cash flow conversion has improved, but it does not provide the exact percentage improvement and uses a different calculation method (using net cash used for investing activities as a proxy for capital expenditures) than the ground truth, which uses a more precise calculation.",novel-generated,Adobe,ADOBE_2022_10K,10k

16,Roughly how many times has AES Corporation sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for the FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.,AES has converted inventory 9.5 times in FY 2022.,"Conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company. 

The company operates membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering low prices on a limited selection of products will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. However, the company's business model is designed to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before payments to suppliers come due. This means that the company's inventory turnover is not a meaningful measure of its inventory management efficiency.

Additionally, the company's inventory turnover is affected by numerous factors, including product mix, mix of sales by the company and third-party sellers, focus on in-stock inventory availability, investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which the company chooses to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. These factors make it difficult to calculate a meaningful inventory turnover ratio for the company.

However, if we were to calculate the inventory turnover ratio for FY2022, we would need the cost of goods sold and the average inventory for FY2022.

DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,93.86,"To calculate Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO), we need to find the following values:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017
2. FY2017 COGS
3. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017

From the balance sheet, we can find the following values:

- Accounts payable for FY2016: $4,768 million
- Accounts payable for FY2017: $5,097 million
- Inventory for FY2016: $11,461 million
- Inventory for FY2017: $16,047 million

From the P&L statement, we can find the following value:

- FY2017 COGS: $111,934 million (Cost of sales)

Now, we can calculate the required values:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017:
   = ($4,768 million + $5,097 million) / 2
   = $4,932.5 million

2. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017:

30,"Answer the following question as if you are an equity research analyst and have lost internet connection so you do not have access to financial metric providers. According to the details clearly outlined within the P&L statement and the statement of cash flows, what is the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A from cash flow statement) % margin for AMD?",4.2%,"The company in the provided context is Adobe Systems Incorporated, not AMD. 

To calculate the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A) % margin for Adobe Systems Incorporated, we need to find the total D&A expense and the total revenue.

From the provided context, the depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for fiscal 2015 was $146.3 million. Additionally, the amortization expense related to purchased and other intangible assets was $174.5 million. 

Total D&A expense = Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment + Amortization expense related to purchased and other intangible assets
Total D&A expense = $146.3 million + $174.5 million
Total D&A expense = $320.8 million

The total revenue for fiscal 2015 was $4,795,511.

D&A % margin = (Total D&A expense / Total revenue) * 100
D&A % margin = ($320.8 million / $4,795,511) * 100
D&A % margin = 6.69%

So, the FY2015 depreciation and amortization (D&A) % margin for Adobe Systems Incorporated is 6.69%.",0.2470643729659438,497.10988998413086,2160.93373298645,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf,,0.0,"The predicted answer is completely incorrect and irrelevant as it provides the D&A % margin for Adobe Systems Incorporated instead of AMD, which was the company in question.",metrics-generated,AMD,AMD_2015_10K,10k

For 3M, the operating income margin decreased to 19.1% in 2022 from 20.8% in 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by declines in disposable respirator demand, manufacturing headwinds, and increased investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.

However, the provided context does not contain sufficient information about Best Buy's financial statements for FY2015 - FY2017. The context appears to be a mix of financial statements from different companies, including 3M, Amazon, and Adobe.

Since the question specifically asks for Best Buy's financial information, and it is not provided in the context, we cannot accurately calculate the 3-year average net profit margin for Best Buy.

However, based on the provided instructions to always attempt an answer, we can try to find a possible solution. Unfortunately, without the necessary information, we cannot provide a reliable answer.

If we were to make an assumption, we could look at the financial statements provided for other companies, but this would not be accurate for Best Buy. 

Therefore, I will provide a placeholder answer, but please note that this is not a reliable or accurate answer.

57,What is the FY2019 - FY2020 total revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square)? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Approach the question asked by assuming the standpoint of an investment banking analyst who only has access to the statement of income.,101.5%,"To calculate the total revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square) from FY2019 to FY2020, we need to use the total net revenue figures for both years.

Total net revenue for FY2019: $4,713,500
Total net revenue for FY2020: $9,497,578

To calculate the growth rate, we can use the following formula:

Growth Rate = ((FY2020 Revenue - FY2019 Revenue) / FY2019 Revenue) * 100

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

Growth Rate = (($9,497,578 - $4,713,500) / $4,713,500) * 100
Growth Rate = ($4,784,078 / $4,713,500) * 100
Growth Rate = 101.6%

Rounded to one decimal place, the total revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square) from FY2019 to FY2020 is 101.6%.",0.28661251369303753,825.9010314941406,1922.9803085327148,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf,,0.9,"The predicted answer is very close to the ground truth, with a minor difference in the calculated growth rate (101.6% vs 101.5%).

68,What is Coca Cola's FY2021 COGS % margin? Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the income statement.,39.7%,"The provided context does not mention Coca Cola, but rather appears to be discussing a different company. However, I will attempt to answer the question based on the available information.

To calculate the COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) percentage margin, we need to know the COGS and the net sales. Unfortunately, the context does not provide the COGS directly. However, we can calculate the COGS using the gross margin percentage.

The context mentions that the gross margin percentage, excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation, was 11.22%. We also know that the net sales increased by $28,832 or 18% during 2021.

Let's assume the net sales for 2020 was x. Then, the net sales for 2021 would be 1.18x.

The context also mentions that the gross margin percentage decreased by 7 basis points compared to 2020. However, excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation, the gross margin percentage increased by 2 basis points.

Since we don't have the exact net sales for 2020, we can use the SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales to estimate the net sales. The SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 40 basis points compared to 2020.

Using the SG&A expenses for 2020 ($16,332) and the SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for 2020 (10.01%), we can estimate the net sales for 2020:

Net sales 2020 = SG&A expenses 2020 / SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 2020
Net sales 2020 = $16,332 / 0.1001
Net sales 2020 ≈ $163,111

Now, we can estimate the net sales for 2021:

Net sales 2021 = 1.18 x Net sales 2020
Net sales 2021 ≈ 1.18 x $163,111
Net sales 2021 ≈ $192,511

Using the gross margin percentage (11.22%), we can estimate the gross profit:

Gross profit = Net sales 2021 x Gross margin percentage
Gross profit ≈ $192,511 x 0.1122
Gross profit ≈ $21,573

Now, we can estimate the COGS:

COGS = Net sales 2021 - Gross profit
COGS ≈ $192,511 - $21,573
COGS ≈ $170,938

69,What is Coca Cola's FY2022 dividend payout ratio (using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders)? Round answer to two decimal places. Answer the question asked by assuming you only have access to information clearly displayed in the cash flow statement and the income statement.,0.8,"To calculate the dividend payout ratio, we need to find the total cash dividends paid and the net income attributable to shareholders.

From the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we can find the total cash dividends paid: 
Total cash dividends paid = $7,617 million (2022)

From the Consolidated Statements of Income, we can find the net income attributable to shareholders: 
Net income attributable to shareholders = $9,542 million (2022)

Now, we can calculate the dividend payout ratio:
Dividend payout ratio = Total cash dividends paid / Net income attributable to shareholders
= $7,617 million / $9,542 million
= 0.80

Round your answer to two decimal places.",63.86,"There is no information provided about Corning in the given context. The context appears to be related to multiple companies, including Activision Blizzard, Amazon, and Square. However, it does not provide the necessary information to calculate the days payable outstanding (DPO) for Corning.

To provide an answer based on the available context, I will attempt to calculate the DPO for one of the mentioned companies. However, please note that the calculation might not be accurate due to the lack of specific information.

Assuming we are calculating the DPO for Amazon (as it has the most relevant information), we need the following data:

- Average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020
- FY2020 COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020

From the provided context, we can find the following information:

- Accounts payable for FY2019: $8,193 million (from the statement of cash flows)
- Accounts payable for FY2020: Not available
- COGS for FY2020: Not available
- Change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020: -$3,278 million (from the statement of cash flows) and $1,314 million (from the statement of cash flows for the previous year), but we need the actual inventory values to calculate the change.

Since we do not have the necessary information to calculate the DPO accurately, I will provide a hypothetical answer based on the available data.

Assuming the average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020 is $8,193 million (using only the available data), and considering the lack of information on COGS and inventory values, we cannot accurately calculate the DPO.

However, to provide a hypothetical answer, let's assume the COGS and change in inventory are available, and the calculation yields a result. In that case, the answer would be:

DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable) / (COGS + change in inventory)

Net sales for 2019 and 2021 are available:

2019 2021 
Net sales $ 170,684 $ 192,052 

However, net sales for 2018 are not available in the provided context. But we can find the net sales for 2018 from the information about the change in net sales.

Net sales increased $28,832 or 18% during 2021. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales of 16%, and sales at new warehouses opened in 2020 and 2021.

Net sales for 2020 can be calculated as follows:
Net sales for 2020 = Net sales for 2021 / (1 + 0.18) 
Net sales for 2020 = $192,052 / 1.18 
Net sales for 2020 = $163,220 

Net sales for 2019 increased 13% in 2019, compared to the prior year.

Net sales for 2018 can be calculated as follows:
Net sales for 2018 = Net sales for 2019 / (1 + 0.13) 
Net sales for 2018 = $170,684 / 1.13 
Net sales for 2018 = $151,000 

Now we can calculate the operating income % margin for each year:

2018: Operating income % margin = ($12,421 / $151,000) * 100% ≈ 8.2%
2019: Operating income % margin = ($14,541 / $170,684) * 100% ≈ 8.5%
2021: Operating income % margin = (Not available, but we can use the information about the change in operating income)

75,What is the FY2018 fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health? Fixed asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2018 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018). Round your answer to two decimal places. Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the P&L statement and the balance sheet.,17.98,"To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health in FY2018, we need to find the FY2018 revenue and the average property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) between FY2017 and FY2018.

However, the provided context does not contain sufficient information about CVS Health. The context appears to be related to 3M and other companies, but not CVS Health.

Based on the available information, I will provide a hypothetical answer. 

Assuming the FY2018 revenue for CVS Health is $195,929 million (from the table of contents) and the PP&E for FY2017 and FY2018 are $38,366 million and $39,589 million, respectively (from the table of contents), we can calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio as follows:

Average PP&E = (PP&E in FY2017 + PP&E in FY2018) / 2
= ($38,366 million + $39,589 million) / 2
= $39,027.5 million

Fixed asset turnover ratio = FY2018 revenue / Average PP&E
= $195,929 million / $39,027.5 million
= 5.02

81,What is the FY2019 cash conversion cycle (CCC) for General Mills? CCC is defined as: DIO + DSO - DPO. DIO is defined as: 365 * (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS). DSO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 Revenue). DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS + change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the income statement and the balance sheet.,-3.7,"The question is asking for the FY2019 cash conversion cycle (CCC) for General Mills, but the provided context is for 3M. However, I will provide an answer based on the available information for 3M.

To calculate the CCC, we need to calculate DIO, DSO, and DPO.

DIO = 365 * (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS)

From the provided context, we can find the following information:

- FY2018 inventory: $13,709 (current assets) - $7,244 (current liabilities) + $332 million (increase in inventory) = $6,797 million (inventory)
- FY2019 inventory: $6,797 million + $3,583 million (increase in inventory) = $10,380 million (inventory)
- Average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019: ($6,797 million + $10,380 million) / 2 = $8,588.5 million
- FY2019 COGS: Not directly available, but we can estimate it using the FY2019 net sales and the FY2018 cost of sales percentage. 
  - FY2018 net sales: Not directly available, but we can estimate it using the FY2018 net income and the FY2018 net income margin. 
    - FY2018 net income: $5,363 million
    - FY2018 net income margin: 22.0% (operating income margin)
    - Estimated FY2018 net sales: $5,363 million / 0.22 = $24,388 million
  - FY2018 cost of sales percentage: 50.9%
  - Estimated FY2018 cost of sales: $24,388 million * 0.509 = $12,407 million
  - Estimated FY2019 net sales: Not directly available, but we can estimate it using the FY2019 net income and the FY2019 net income margin. 
    - FY2019 net income: Not directly available, but we can estimate it using the FY2019 net cash provided by operating activities and the FY2018 net income margin. 
      - FY2019 net cash provided by operating activities: $38,514 million
      - Estimated FY2019 net income: $38,514 million * 0.22 = $8,473 million (this is a rough estimate and may not be accurate)

84,We want to calculate a financial metric. Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the cash flow statement and the income statement. Here's the question: what is the FY2022 retention ratio (using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders) for General Mills? Round answer to two decimal places.,0.54,"To calculate the retention ratio, we need to know the total cash dividends paid and the net income attributable to shareholders. However, the provided context does not contain information about General Mills. It appears to be related to 3M and The Coca-Cola Company.

Assuming the question is referring to 3M, we can calculate the retention ratio using the available data.

From the provided context, we can find the following information for 3M:

- Net income attributable to shareholders: $4,756 million (from NOTE 15. NET INCOME PER SHARE)
- Total cash dividends paid: Not explicitly stated, but we can calculate it using the dividend per share and the number of shares outstanding.

From the provided context, we can find the following information for 3M:

- Dividend per share: $1.76 (from THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREOWNERS’ EQUITY)
- Number of shares outstanding: 469.5 million (from NOTE 15. NET INCOME PER SHARE)

Total cash dividends paid = Dividend per share * Number of shares outstanding
Total cash dividends paid = $1.76 * 469.5 million
Total cash dividends paid = $826.32 million

Retention ratio = (Net income attributable to shareholders - Total cash dividends paid) / Net income attributable to shareholders
Retention ratio = ($4,756 million - $826.32 million) / $4,756 million
Retention ratio = 0.8263 / 1

87,Roughly how many times has JnJ sold its inventory in FY2022? Calculate inventory turnover ratio for FY2022; if conventional inventory management is not meaningful for the company then state that and explain why.,JnJ sold its inventory 2.7 times in FY2022.,"To calculate the inventory turnover ratio for FY2022, we need to know the cost of goods sold (COGS) and the average inventory for FY2022. However, the provided context does not contain this information for JnJ. 

The provided context contains information about 3M and Coca-Cola. For 3M, the cost of goods sold is not provided, but the inventories at the end of FY2022 and FY2021 are $4,233 million and $3,414 million, respectively. 

Assuming the average inventory for FY2022 is the average of the inventories at the end of FY2022 and FY2021, we can calculate the average inventory as follows:

Average inventory = ($4,233 million + $3,414 million) / 2 = $3,823.5 million

However, without the COGS, we cannot calculate the inventory turnover ratio.

For Coca-Cola, the context does not provide the necessary information to calculate the inventory turnover ratio.

As for JnJ, since there is no information provided about JnJ's inventory or COGS, we cannot calculate the inventory turnover ratio.

However, based on the information provided about Amazon in the context, it seems that conventional inventory management may not be meaningful for Amazon. This is because Amazon's business model involves third-party sellers maintaining ownership of their inventory, and Amazon provides fulfillment services for these sellers. Therefore, Amazon's inventory may not accurately reflect its business operations.",0.5792324963456318,767.214298248291,3294.3830490112305,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf,,0.0,"The predicted answer does not contain any information about JnJ's inventory turnover ratio and does not provide the correct answer of 2.7 times, making it completely incorrect and irrelevant to the question asked.",domain-relevant,Johnson & Johnson,JOHNSON_JOHNSON_2022_10K,10k

- Gross margin for FY2018: Not directly provided, but we can estimate it from the operating income and other expenses.
- Operating income for FY2018: $7,207 million
- Other expenses for FY2018: Not directly provided, but we can estimate them from the provided information.

Assuming an average gross margin of around 50% (which is a rough estimate and may not be accurate), we can estimate the COGS for FY2018 as follows:

COGS (FY2018) = Net sales (FY2018) - Gross profit (FY2018)
= $32,765 million - (50% of $32,765 million)
= $32,765 million - $16,382.5 million
= $16,382.5 million

The provided context contains the following information about inventory:

- Inventory at the end of FY2018: Not directly provided, but we can estimate it from the provided information.
- Inventory at the end of FY2017: Not directly provided, but we can estimate it from the provided information.

The provided context contains the following information:

- Increase in inventory from FY2017 to FY2018: $332 million
- Inventory at the end of FY2017: Not directly provided, but we can estimate it from the provided information.

Assuming the inventory at the end of FY2017 was around $1,559 million (which is a rough estimate and may not be accurate), we can estimate the inventory at the end of FY2018 as follows:

Inventory (FY2018) = Inventory (FY2017) + Increase in inventory
= $1,559 million + $332 million
= $1,891 million

The average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 is not directly provided, but we can estimate it as follows:

Average inventory = (Inventory (FY2018) + Inventory (FY2019)) / 2

100,"We need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric. Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the balance sheet and the P&L statement, what is Lockheed Martin's FY2020 asset turnover ratio? Asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2020 revenue / (average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.",1.33,"The provided context does not contain sufficient information about Lockheed Martin. However, based on the available information about Activision Blizzard, Inc., we can calculate the asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard, Inc.

To calculate the asset turnover ratio, we need the revenue for FY2020 and the average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020.

The revenue for FY2020 is not provided in the context. However, we can calculate the average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020.

Total assets for FY2019 = $4,551,258 (from the balance sheet)
Total assets for FY2020 = Not provided, but we can use the total assets for FY2018 and FY2019 to estimate the average total assets.

Total assets for FY2018 = $4,021 (from the long-lived assets table, but this is not the total assets, it's the long-lived assets)
We cannot calculate the average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020.

However, we can use the total assets for FY2019 and the total assets for FY2018 (which is not provided) to estimate the average total assets.

Assuming the total assets for FY2020 is around the same as FY2019, we can estimate the average total assets.

Average total assets = (Total assets for FY2019 + Total assets for FY2020) / 2
= ($4,551,258 + $4,551,258) / 2 (assuming total assets for FY2020 is the same as FY2019)
= $4,551,258

However, we still need the revenue for FY2020 to calculate the asset turnover ratio.

Since we cannot calculate the asset turnover ratio for Lockheed Martin (which is not mentioned in the context) and we cannot calculate the asset turnover ratio for Activision Blizzard, Inc. due to the lack of revenue data for FY2020, we cannot provide a numerical answer.

However, based on the provided instructions, we should provide an answer. Since we cannot calculate the asset turnover ratio, we will provide a hypothetical answer.

Assuming the revenue for FY2020 is $X, the asset turnover ratio would be:

Asset turnover ratio = FY2020 revenue / (average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020)
= $X / $4,551,258

Since we don't know the revenue for FY2020, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, based on the provided instructions, we should provide an answer.

112,We want to calculate a financial metric. Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the statement of income and the statement of cash flows. Here's the question: what is the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix? Calculate unadjusted EBITDA using unadjusted operating income and D&A (from cash flow statement).,5.4%,"To calculate the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix, we need to find the unadjusted operating income and depreciation and amortization (D&A) for FY2015.

However, the provided context does not contain the necessary information for Netflix. The context appears to be related to Square and 3M, but not Netflix.

Based on the available information, I will provide a hypothetical answer. If we assume that the operating income for FY2015 is $1,267,118 (from the table presenting a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA) and the D&A for FY2015 is $27,626 (from the same table), we can calculate the unadjusted EBITDA as follows:

Unadjusted EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A
= $1,267,118 + $27,626
= $1,294,744

To calculate the unadjusted EBITDA % margin, we need to know the total revenue for FY2015. Assuming the total revenue is $1,267,118 (from the table presenting a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA), we can calculate the unadjusted EBITDA % margin as follows:

Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenue) * 100
= ($1,294,744 / $1,267,118) * 100
= 102.2%

To calculate the inventory turnover ratio for Costco, we need to calculate the average inventory between FY2020 and FY2021.

Average inventory = ($14,215 + $12,242) / 2

123,What is the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA less capex for PepsiCo? Define unadjusted EBITDA as unadjusted operating income + depreciation and amortization [from cash flow statement]. Answer in USD millions. Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the statement of cash flows and the income statement.,$9068.00,"The provided context does not contain sufficient information about PepsiCo. However, based on the available information, I can provide an answer for The Coca-Cola Company.

To calculate the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA less capex for The Coca-Cola Company, we need to use the information from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statements of Income.

From the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, we can find the depreciation and amortization for FY2022: $1,831 million.

From the Consolidated Statements of Income, we can find the operating income for FY2022: $10,909 million.

Unadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted operating income + Depreciation and amortization
Unadjusted EBITDA = $10,909 million + $1,831 million
Unadjusted EBITDA = $12,740 million

To calculate the unadjusted EBITDA less capex, we need to subtract the capital expenditures from the unadjusted EBITDA. However, the provided context does not contain the exact capital expenditures for FY2022. But we can find the ""Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives"" for FY2022: $58,321 million.

Unadjusted EBITDA less capex = Unadjusted EBITDA - Capital expenditures
Unadjusted EBITDA less capex = $12,740 million - $58,321 million
Unadjusted EBITDA less capex = -$45,581 million",0.21484807671528397,930.1791191101074,2337.148904800415,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/COCACOLA_2022_10K.pdf,,0.0,"The predicted answer is completely irrelevant as it provides information about The Coca-Cola Company instead of PepsiCo, and does not contain any correct information about the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA less capex for PepsiCo.",metrics-generated,PepsiCo,PEPSICO_2022_10K,10k

147,What is FY2018 days payable outstanding (DPO) for Walmart? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2017 and FY2018) / (FY2018 COGS + change in inventory between FY2017 and FY2018). Round your answer to two decimal places. Please base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the statement of financial position and the P&L statement.,42.69,"To calculate the days payable outstanding (DPO) for FY2018, we need the following information:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2017 and FY2018
2. FY2018 COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
3. Change in inventory between FY2017 and FY2018

However, the provided context does not contain sufficient information about Walmart's financial statements. The context appears to be related to Costco Wholesale Corporation and another company (likely Square, Inc. or Block, Inc.), but not Walmart.

Since we cannot find the required information for Walmart, we will use the available data from Costco Wholesale Corporation to provide a hypothetical answer. Please note that this answer is not accurate for Walmart.

From the provided context, we can find the following information for Costco Wholesale Corporation:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2017 and FY2018:
   Accounts payable at the end of FY2017: $14,745 million (from the balance sheet)
   Accounts payable at the end of FY2018: $13,067 million (from the balance sheet)
   Average accounts payable: ($14,745 + $13,067) / 2 = $13,906 million

2. FY2018 COGS:
   Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain the COGS information for Costco Wholesale Corporation. However, we can find the merchandise inventories information:
   Merchandise inventories at the end of FY2017: $3,742 million (from the balance sheet)
   Merchandise inventories at the end of FY2018: $2,500 million (from the balance sheet)
   Change in inventory: $3,742 - $2,500 = $1,242 million (decrease in inventory)

   Since we cannot find the COGS information, we will assume that the COGS is approximately equal to the merchandise inventories at the end of FY2017. This is a rough estimate and may not be accurate.
   COGS ≈ $3,742 million (merchandise inventories at the end of FY2017)

Now, we can calculate the DPO:

DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable) / (COGS + change in inventory)
DPO ≈ 365 * $13,906 / ($3,742 + $1,242)
DPO ≈ 365 * $13,906 / $4,984
DPO ≈ 1,046.41 days
